I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Viktor Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). I received B.Sc. in Computer Science at Bilkent University. Previously, I conducted research with [Prof. Tudor Dumitras](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/) at the University of Maryland, investigating the impact of malware variability on machine learning models.

My current research include:

- Efficient & robust LLM reasoning
- Graph Neural Networks
- Temporal knowledge graphs and their applications
