I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Viktor Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). I receieved B.Sc. in Computer Science at Bilkent University. Previously, I conducted research with [Prof. Tudor Dumitras]((https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/)) at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS), investigating the impact of malware variability on machine learning models. My research centers on machine learning for graph-structured data and the integration of large language models (LLMs) with graph-based approaches. Key areas of interest include: 

- Uncertainty modeling in graph neural networks (GNNs)
- Scaling GNNs for large-scale applications
- Temporal knowledge graphs and their applications
- Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
